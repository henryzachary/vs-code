//must be able to do at least 4 different conversions (the more the better). 
//For example, kg to lb, gram to ounces, km to mile, mm to inch, etc.
//should continue accepting user inputs until the user inputs something like "exit"
//"Welcome to metric converter! 

//Please input your query. For example, 1 km = m. 

//Enter 'exit' or '-1' to exit the program"

//If a user input something that is not handled, you should print something to remind the user the valid input format, e.g.,

//"Your input is not currently handled by this app, please input another query, for example, 1 kg = lb"
